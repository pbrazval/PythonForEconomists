**Course Syllabus**   

Econ 294A, Spring 2024

This course aims to offer students a comprehensive introduction to Python, with a special emphasis on its applications within Economics and Data Science. Our objective is to build foundational programming skills and cover a broad selection of Python packages, equipping students with prior exposure to leverage Python for a wide range of applications.

### Optional references

Several references on Python usually focus on specific packages or use cases. The main benefit of checking a book or a package documentation link when in doubt, as a complement to Stack Overflow and ChatGPT, is serendipity -- you'll probably learn more than what you were looking for.


You don't need to buy any of the following books. They will cover a wider range of topics than we can cover in class.

	- Matthes, Eric. Python Crash Course. 3rd edition.
	- McKinney, Wes. Python for Data Analysis. 2nd edition.
	- Ramalho, Luciano. Fluent Python. 2nd edition.
	- G\'{e}ron, Aur\'{e}lien. Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow. 3rd edition. 



The official documentation links for some common packages are below. Python is a very well-documented language. If you don't understand the logic of a function, checking its documentation from the source will be useful. You'll also stumble upon new functions from the same package that may help you in future coding -- rather than reinventing the wheel, you can find a pythonic way of elegantly coding what you want.


	- Numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/index.html
	- Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html
	- Statsmodels: https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html
	- Matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/


Especially for base Python, Numpy, and Pandas, I strongly recommend having printed cheat sheets close by while coding, as they will help you remember common function names more easily. Check Canvas for the added files.
